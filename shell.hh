/*
 * CS252: Shell project
 *
 * Template file.
 * You will need to add more code here to execute the command table.
 *
 * NOTE: You are responsible for fixing any bugs this code may have!
 *
 * DO NOT PUT THIS PROJECT IN A PUBLIC REPOSITORY LIKE GIT. IF YOU WANT
 * TO MAKE IT PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE YOU NEED TO REMOVE ANY SKELETON CODE
 * AND REWRITE YOUR PROJECT SO IT IMPLEMENTS FUNCTIONALITY DIFFERENT THAN
 * WHAT IS SPECIFIED IN THE HANDOUT. WE OFTEN REUSE PART OF THE PROJECTS FROM
 * SEMESTER TO SEMESTER AND PUTTING YOUR CODE IN A PUBLIC REPOSITORY
 * MAY FACILITATE ACADEMIC DISHONESTY.
